            <p>Duncan was born in France and moved to Quebec at a very young age of 3. He stayed there for one year
            of Kindergarten and then moved to his current hometown of Coquitlam, BC. He started grade 1 a year early
            which permitted him to then graduate 1 year early at 17 years old. He took a year off to work and is 
            hoping to find a great job in software developing.</p>
