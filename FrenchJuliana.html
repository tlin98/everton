            <p>Juliana was born in North Vancouver, BC and has lived in Vancouver all her life so far. She likes
              jigsaw puzzles, reading, and walking her dog. She has a degree in Geography but wanted more out of
              her education so that's why she's at BCIT unpuzzling programming.
